Add radix tree implementation of obmalloc's address_in_range().  Use it
by default on 64-bit platforms.  The radix tree eliminates the
(slightly) memory unsanitary behavior of the current address_in_range()
approach.  It also has the small advantage of easily allowing larger
pool sizes.  The current address_in_range() requires that pools be no
larger than the OS page size.
